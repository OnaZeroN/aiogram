The new FSM strategy CHAT_TOPIC, which sets the state for the entire topic in the chat, also works in private messages and regular groups without topics.
Aiogram did not have an FSM strategy that would set state only for a specific topic in the chat. This strategy is quite reasonable and it has many applications.
The work of state in private messages remains unchanged
The work of state in groups / super groups without topics, state will be established for all groups
The work of state in groups /super groups with topics, State will be established only for one topic, other topics will not have a state until it is installed, state can be set separately for each topic, and state_data will be separate in all topics where state is installed.
